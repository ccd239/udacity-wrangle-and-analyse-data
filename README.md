# ABOUT THE HUMAN'S BEST FRIEND

**learning how to gather, assess and analyse data the funny way**

This is the repo of one of my 1st projects of data analysis while learning w/ Udacity. Learned how to use Twitter (new X) API.

The main goal of this project was to go through all of the steps to Gather, Assess, Clean and get insights from data.

In the Gathering part, 3 different methods were used:
- download a CSV file manually
- programatically download a file using requests library
- query data from an API

It was interesting to learn how to handlw different files and data formats like CSV, TSV and JSON.

Next, in the Assessment part, I explored the data from the different sources, searching for dirty and messy data.
In this process, I learned that, although not the funniest, visual assessment is so important that is almost imperative. 

The cleaning part was so much easier after a proper Assessment. The issues were already listed, so I just had to act on them!

And at last but not least, the Analysis and Visualization of the Data! This part was super fun, since the theme is very unusual and laid back. 

## Documents Guide

This project is divided in 3 different jupyter notebooks:
* wrangle_act - where the code for all the steps described above is;
* wrangle_report - where I explain my process thinking for all the assessment and cleaning steps;
* act_report - where I explose my findings.
